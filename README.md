# The Monkees - Official Website

## About the Project:

This website made as my first Milestone project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). 
The main goal was to create a responsive, user centric frontend website using the HTML5 and CSS3 technology.
On the website the user can navigate between the pages easily and they can use the website on every device as well thanks 
for the responsive design and implementation.

- Throughout this project I had to create a website for a band called The Monkees. As the website is a static (front-end only) website
we have opportunity:
    - Check the website on every device easily
    - Navigate between the pages
    - Get information about their tour:
        - Where will be the next concerts 
        - When will be the next concerts 
        - How many ticket are available 
    - Find information about the band members
    - Listen some sample song and watch video clips from the band
    - Send request for the band if We would like to invite them for our private party
    - Check the band's social sites

## UX
 
- The Website is very colorful because these vivid colours connects to the band image. I use those kinds of colors that 
are simple and dominant in the Band life and in those years when they were young in the 70's. 
- The two dominant font family is "Special Elite" and "ZCOOL KuaiLe" which are google fonts. I imported those fonts through 
the .css style file from the google fonts repository.
- I used the "font awesome" font and icon toolkit for the social link icons.
- Hover effects on those elements where there is interaction
    - Navigation
    - Buttons
        - Buy tickets
        - Send request
    - Social links
- Favicon (Shortcut icon) with "M" sign on every page.

## Features

you can reach the outer social sites. The main feature for this project is the responsive design and implementation 
furthermore the user centric development.

## Testing

Thanks to the "GitHub Pages" option on the GitHub website everybody can reach my website through the below link: 
https://istvangercsak.github.io/TheMonkees/

I prefer the GitHub Pages option instead of the Cloud9 because it is stable and available 24/7.

**Test types:**
- Manual tests
- Smoke tests on PC and Mobile
- Non-Functional tests (usability, reliability)
    - Usability:
        - The ease of use and learn to use the website
    - Reliability:
        - Stable and consistent result

**Test cases for the user stories:**

## Deployment

- **Set up**:
    - As my first step and as I use local IDE for create the project, I installed the Git locally and synchronized my local IDE 
    with the local git. I use IntelliJ Pycharm for the front end development with its helpful built in deployment tools. 
    After I created a Git and GitHub repository, I could start to work.
- **Commits**:
    - After every small piece and increment, I made commit to my local Git repository. After that on the end of the 
    bigger section that gives value to my project I pushed my modification to my GitHub repository.
